Longer part


Juggling with C#, TypeScript, and Python. I have written professional software with all of them, but still can’t pick my favorite.  
I am very enthusiastic about engineering. That is my craft. Building stuff is what I do, and that is my greatest passion. Hence, full house of LEGOs.
Lately, I am concentrating on distributed systems and edge technologies.
Even though I love the role of an individual contributor, the goal is always to share knowledge with others. Hence, teaching position at University.
