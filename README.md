### Hi there 👋

TL;DR part

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Geo Distributed Stateful Serverless platform
- 👀 I’m interested in programming languages, databases, APIs, WebAssembly and Edge/Cloud computing.

### Longer part

Building “edge as a service” - The worlds first Geo Distributed Stateful Serverless platform for real-time apps & APIs

Juggling with C#, TypeScript, and Python. I have written professional software with all of them, but I still can’t pick my favorite. 

I am very enthusiastic about engineering. That is my craft. Building stuff is what I do.
Lately, I am concentrating on distributed systems, edge technologies, and webassembly.

Even though I love the role of an individual contributor, the goal is always to share knowledge with others.
Hence, teaching position at university.
